switch block:

switch block is used to select 1 option from list of multiple options.

int m=5;

switch(m)
{
	case 10:
		printf("\n Good Morning");
		
	case 5: 		
		printf("\n Good Evening");
		

	case 7: 		
		printf("\n Hello");	

	
	case -9: printf("\n ABC");
		break;

	case 11: printf("\n MNO");

	case 3: printf("\n XYZ");	

}

Here we have used m variable as the switch block variable. Compiler will check what is value of m variable. 
Then compiler will compare the value of m variable with the numbers mentioned with all the cases in the switch block. 
So control will directly go to the case 5, because m variable value is 5. So Good Evening is displayed on screen.
Because there is no break statement in case 5, so control will remain inside the switch block and go to next below case,which is case 7 and Hello is printed. There is no break statement in case 7 so control will go to next case -9, and ABC is printed.
After ABC is printed, the break statement will take control out of switch block.

So output is:
Good Evening
Hello
ABC




int m=15;

switch(m)
{
	case 10:
		printf("\n Good Morning");
		
	case 5: 		
		printf("\n Good Evening");
		

	case 7: 		
		printf("\n Hello");	

	
	case -9: printf("\n ABC");
		break;

	case 11: printf("\n MNO");

	case 3: printf("\n XYZ");	

}
Because value of m variable is 15, and because there is no case in switch block having number 15, so no case will run and so no output is printed.


int m=15;

switch(m)
{
	case 10:
		printf("\n Good Morning");
		
	default: 		
		printf("\n Good Evening");
		

	case 7: 		
		printf("\n Hello");	

	
	case -9: printf("\n ABC");
		break;

	case 11: printf("\n MNO");

	case 3: printf("\n XYZ");	

}
default is a keyword in C language. If the value of the switch block variable, doesnt match with any number of any case inside the switch block, the control will directly go to the default case.

So output is:
Good Evening
Hello
ABC
